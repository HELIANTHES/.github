## 🔧 Projects

### 🌐 CapConnect  
**AI-powered investor discovery platform**  
A hybrid system combining semantic search and graph reasoning to identify the best-fit investors for a given fundraise. CapConnect maps relationships between people, firms, co-investments, and shared affiliations using Pinecone and Neo4j, and leverages LangGraph to route requests through a multi-agent backend.

- Relationship-aware matching (e.g., co-investors, past employers, shared schools)
- Multi-agent architecture using LangGraph + OpenAI
- Warm intro path scoring and connection reasoning
- Used by fund managers and emerging managers to source LPs and partners

### 🧠 Intellica  
**Agentic RAG for investment memo generation**  
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that ingests unstructured datarooms and synthesizes detailed investment memos. Intellica combines metadata-driven chunking, vector search (via Pinecone), structured prompt templates, and agent workflows to generate high-quality insights for investors.

- Structured memo generation from legal, financial, and market docs
- Modular, agent-based architecture (LangGraph)
- Multi-source context retrieval and synthesis

## 💼 Background

Jaron Armiger is a self-taught engineer and founder of Hélianthès Studio. He previously served as Chief AI Officer at Carviz and has led technical strategy at multiple early-stage startups. His work spans:

- **Agentic AI** (LangGraph, OpenAI, multi-agent orchestration)
- **RAG Systems** (Pinecone, custom prompt pipelines, structured chunking)
- **Full-Stack Development** (Next.js, FastAPI, TypeScript, Python)
- **Cloud Infrastructure** (AWS Lambda, S3, serverless workflows)

What sets his approach apart is a distinct creative perspective — drawing from the precision of Wes Anderson and the emotional tone of *Blonde*, he treats AI as a medium for clarity, emotion, and design.
